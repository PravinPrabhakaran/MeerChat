#Meerchat

Using the GPT API - this bot is designed to assist CompareTheMarket customers in answering questions they have about their insurance policies. 

It allows customers to enter a provider, like "coverwise". They can then choose from different sections and ask the bot questions. Under the hood, GPT API is provided with context about this section and the inputted question. 

There is no customer or private data shared and the insurance policy document is obtained directly from a public source (CTM website).

The bot is effective at providing objective advice in an agent-like tone. It can also remembers the conversation. A proper prototype would need to work on a better data capture method and handle errors properly.

(A second branch includes a side-by-side view where the insurance policy is open in the same window, but the chatbot takes only a 1/3 of the screen width - allowing users to ask queries whilst reading the insurance policy.)
